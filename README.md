## 📝 About the Platform


**NeuroBot Vision** is a powerful online visual development platform aimed at lowering the barriers to entry for computer vision technology. It helps developers, researchers, and enterprises build, deploy, and manage intelligent visual applications quickly.

Whether it's object detection, image segmentation, classification, or more complex tasks, NeuroBot Vision offers an intuitive UI and robust backend support to manage the full lifecycle from data annotation to model training and deployment.

The platform adopts a decoupled frontend-backend architecture:
- **Frontend:** Built with Vue
- **Backend:** Spring Framework + Python ML ecosystem

## ✨ Features

### 1. Data Management & Annotation
- Supports uploading and managing various image formats
- Provides intuitive annotation tools (bounding boxes, polygons, keypoints)
- Annotation progress tracking & team collaboration
- Data versioning and rollback

### 2. Model Training & Management
- Visualized training process with parameter tuning
- Built-in classic CV models, ready to use
- Support for custom model import and training
- Real-time training logs and monitoring
- Model versioning and performance comparison

### 3. Vision Tasks Supported
- **Object Detection** – Detect and locate multiple targets
- **Image Segmentation** – Pixel-level object region segmentation
- **Classification** – Image-level content recognition
- **Real-time Video** – Supports live camera and video file analysis

### 4. Deployment & Integration
- One-click deployment as API service
- Supports cloud, edge deployment options
- SDKs and API documentation for easy integration
- Application performance monitoring and logging

### 5. Team Collaboration & Permissions
- Multi-role user and permission control
- Project sharing and collaborative development
- Operation logs and auditing
