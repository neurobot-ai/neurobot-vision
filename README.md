üìù Platform Introduction
NeuroBot Vision is a powerful online vision development platform designed to lower the barrier to computer vision technology, enabling developers, researchers, and enterprises to quickly build, deploy, and manage vision intelligence applications.

Whether it's object detection, image segmentation, object classification, or more complex vision tasks, NeuroBot Vision provides an intuitive interface and robust backend support, helping users manage the entire workflow from data annotation and model training to application deployment.

The platform adopts a frontend-backend separation architecture, with the frontend built on Vue for interactive interfaces and the backend combining the Spring framework with Python's machine learning ecosystem to provide users with an efficient, stable, and scalable vision development experience.
